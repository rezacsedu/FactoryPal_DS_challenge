# FactoryPal data science challenge
This repo contains the solution to FactoryPal data science challenge. 

## Task and problem statement
In this test we use the Covertype Data Set, a dataset describing cartographic features of areas of land in the USA and also its forest type according to the US Forest Service. There are seven classes (1-7), 581012 samples and 54 features. For this test, we're only interested in cover type 3.

## Solutions
I provided step-by-step solution to each question asked, in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/rezacsedu/FactoryPal_DS_challenge/blob/main/data_science_challnge_solution_notebook.ipynb). I could, of course, make the repo more structured by including helper functions as library, but since the notebook contains all the required information, it should be enough for now.
